ts_util
=======

Set of tools for MPEG Transport Stream manipulation. Currently, only supports ts files, and no other medium.

In order to build, run build.sh (with project's root dir as working dir).
This will use bin as output directory for all, which will be ignored by GIT.

Then, in order to install the lib, run 'sudo make install' or similar.
